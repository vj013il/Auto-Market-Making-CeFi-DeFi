# Step-by-Step Guide for Market Making with with TOKEN($966,000)
## 1. Connect $TOKEN to the Software

### If the token is on a CeFi exchange (e.g., Binance):

1. Add the exchange API keys to the config:
```
exchanges:
  binance:
    api_key: "YOUR_API_KEY"
    api_secret: "YOUR_SECRET"
    symbol: "TOKEN/USDT"  # Trading pair
    colocation: true      # FPGA acceleration
```
2. Check the balance through the interface:
```
from quantumflow import ExchangeClient
client = ExchangeClient(exchange="binance")
balance = client.get_balance("TOKEN")
print(f"Available: {balance} $TOKEN")
```
### If the token is on DeFi (e.g., Uniswap):

1. Connect MetaMask via Web3:
```
from quantumflow import DeFiManager
defi = DeFiManager(network="ethereum", private_key="YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY")
defi.connect_pool("TOKEN/ETH", address="0x...")  # Pool address
```

2. Introduce liquidity (optional):
```defi.add_liquidity("TOKEN/ETH", token_amount=1000000, eth_amount=50)```

## 2. Allocate Capital
Market-making (orders): Capital 70% - 5,381,600 $TOKEN
Hedging reserve: Capital 20% - 	1,537,600 $TOKEN
Arbitration: Capital 10% - 768,800 $TOKEN

## 3. Customize the Strategy
### For CeFi (Binance):
```
strategies:
  token_mm:
    spread_mode: "dynamic"       # Dynamic spread
    min_spread: 0.5              # 0.5% (for low-cap)
    max_spread: 2.0              # 2% for volatility
    order_size: 10000            # 10,000 $TOKEN per order
    depth_levels: 5              # 5 levels in a glass
    volatility_window: "4h"       # Volatility window
```
### For DeFi (Uniswap V3):
```
defi_strategies:
  concentrated_liquidity:
    min_price: 0.00001  # Minimum price (in ETH)
    max_price: 0.0001   # Maximum price
    auto_compound: true # Automatic rebalancing
```
## 4. Risk Management
### Auto-hedging via futures (Bybit/Binance Futures)
```
risk_management:
  auto_hedge:
    enabled: true
    ratio: 0.6                 # Hedge 60% of the position
    futures_symbol: "TOKENUSDT" 
```
### Stop loss for the day's loss:
```
  max_daily_loss: -10000       # -$10,000 a day
  circuit_breaker: true        # Full stop at a loss
```
## 5. Arbitrage Scenarios
If $TOKEN is traded on 2+ exchanges:
```
from marketmaker import ArbitrageEngine

arb = ArbitrageEngine(
    pairs=["TOKEN/USDT:binance", "TOKEN/USDC:kucoin"], 
    min_profit=0.3,    # Minimum profit 0.3%
    max_slippage=1.0   # Max. slip 1%
)
arb.start()
```
**Profit Example:**  
At a price difference of 0.5% and 10 trades per day:

966,000×0.548,300/month.

## 6. Protection against Volatility
**Turbo Spread Mode:**
- If volatility jumps > 10%, the spread will automatically widen to 3%.
- The size of orders is halved.

**Whale Alert System:**
```
alerts:
  large_order: 
  threshold: 50000  # $50,000
  action: "cancel_bids"  # Cancel upcoming bid orders
```
## 7 Example of Work in 24 hours
- Buy orders: 50,000 TOKEN priced 0.125 = 80% filled
- Sell orders: 50,000 TOKEN priced 0.1275 = 65% filled
- Binance ↔ KuCoin Arbitrage: 10 trades × $500 = +$5,000
- Hedging: Short position 300,000 $TOKEN = Fall protection

> Total profit: 1,200(spread)+1,200(spread)+5,000 (arbitrage) = $6,200/day.

## 8. Optimization under $TOKEN
- If the token is new (low volume):
  - Increase the spread to 1-2%.
  - Use orders of 0.1-1% of daily volume.

- If the token is trending:
  - Enable Trailing Spread (the spread follows the price).
  - Move 70% of the orders to the side of the trend (e.g. buy on the rise).

## Bottom line
- ✅ Keep the spread at 0.5-1% even for low-liquid TOKEN. ✅ Earn up to 100,000+/month through arbitrage and commissions.
- ✅ Avoid panic selling during volatility.
